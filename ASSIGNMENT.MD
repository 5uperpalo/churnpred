In this assignment you're tasked with developing a machine learning solution for churn prediction to identify which customers are likely to leave a service (column "Exited" in the attached dataset). This assignment is meant to assess

- analytical skills and reasoning
- design and modelling choices, e.g. choices with respect to measuring model performance
- coding skills, e.g. modularity, readability, reproducibility, any other best practices in software development

Please note that multiple solutions may exist and we do not expect a production ready solution, though any reflections on how you may wish to productionalise your solution are welcome. You are free to choose the medium (e.g., notebooks, python scripts). 

Please return your solution by May 2 (9am CET). Once returned, our colleagues with the HR department will schedule the final interview where you'll be asked to walk us through your solution and reflect on any decisions made.
